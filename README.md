### Reflections and Comments

1. How did this go, overall?
    - I was so stressed. I feel like I'm getting ahead of myself for sure like adding stuff that wasn't required and if I mess those up, the entire thing is a mess and I spend too much time fixing it. I need to slow down.

2. What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
    - I really don't know to be honest. Lectures feel really scattered and I feel like I have to self-teach or get other students to explain again during remo.

3. How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
    - Almost 7 hours. That is too long. I had to idea how long it would take me, but I know that is too long.


## About Me Pt.2
