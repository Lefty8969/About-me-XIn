         <p>
        Hello! My name is Xin. I was born in China and moved to the US when I
        was 5. I always wanted to get into acting since a kid. I have the
        opportunity to do that now, but alas, it's not quite that sustainable,
        so here I am learning to code hoping to get into the tech field to make
        money. I am a homebody and with this coding program I am in right now
        makes me even more so... good thing I have a lightbulb to mimic the sun!
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        My goals in life are to do whatever so that I work to live not live to
        work. I'm gonna finish this program, get a job, make bank, and fund my
        hobbies. Maybe travel some more.
      </p>
